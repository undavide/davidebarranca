author: Davide Barranca
excerpt: Capture One 7 looks like a good improvement over the previous version, but shows a nasty bug when you use a particular combination of lens corrections (with raw files coming from P1 digital back at least). Be aware!

  </p>

  <p>
    This has been confirmed by the (incredibly fast, kudos to them!) Phase One tech support, so be aware of it. You need to inspect your images (the exported TIFF) looking for artifacts such as the following white stripes that appear near the corners, up to a third of the image&#8217;s width.
  </p>

  <p>
    The issue may or may not shows even in the Capture One preview, depending on the OpenCL settings and your video card (but who cares, the important thing is that the exported files are affected).

  <p>
    Waiting for a bugfix update!
