Please do yourself a favour and read [this Medium post](https://medium.com/adobetech/the-future-of-extendscript-development-a-vscode-plugin-2d8d0172a357) by _Lead Technical Evangelist_ Ash Ryan Arnwine about the future of the ExtendScript ToolKit.

I'll keep it short because I urge you to read the [original news](https://medium.com/adobetech/the-future-of-extendscript-development-a-vscode-plugin-2d8d0172a357). No ETA yet, but ESTK is gonna die soon won't be re-written to comply with Apple's 32bit applications ban (macOS-next). Nobody in their right mind would have thought it anyway, but we've got an official confirmation.

_\[confetti fall from the sky\]_

Go download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and familiarize with it, while waiting for the new Adobe Scripting plugin (Mac/Win compatible) to be released.
