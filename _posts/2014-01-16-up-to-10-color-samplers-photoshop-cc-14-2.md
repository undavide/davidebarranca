  <p>
    Thanks to last Photoshop World <a title="Photoshop Codeathon)" href="http://blogs.adobe.com/photoshopdotcom/2013/10/engineers-live-code-customer-requested-features-at-photoshop-world.html" target="_blank">Codeathon</a> in Las Vegas, we&#8217;ve finally broken the 4 Color Samplers limit in the Info Palette &#8211; we&#8217;re allowed to scatter up to 10 of them like a machine gun (provided we&#8217;ve Photoshop CC updated to the 14.2 dot release, available from Jan 16, 2014 onwards). If you&#8217;re in the color correction business, that is a big deal.<br /> [Fireworks popping, people getting naked, etc]
  </p>

  <p>
    Now, to be fair, this is a <em>pretty old</em> feature request (ignored/postponed&#8230;) &#8211; something more like a JDI if you will.<br /> But let&#8217;s not be the usual mumbling guys for a little bit! Just a little bit ðŸ˜‰
  </p>

  <p>
    PS<br /> I built an experimental Panel back in 2011, called <a title="Power Info Palette" href="http://blog.rbg.bigano.com/2011/05/22/work-in-progress-power-info-palette/" target="_blank">Power Info Palette</a> &#8211; which still shows that there&#8217;s always room for improvement! But it&#8217;s definitely nice to have native support for 10 samplers in PS now.
