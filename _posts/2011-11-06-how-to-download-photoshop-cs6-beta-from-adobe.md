    <img class="size-full wp-image-133 alignleft" style="border-style: initial;border-color: initial;border-width: 0px" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/adobe.gif" alt="Adobe logo" width="83" height="80" />Screenshots of Photoshop CS6 beta are starting to appear on the internet, with dressing of rumors and comments. By and large, they come from people who downloaded the software from unreliable sources, and usually got into vivid troubles installing and uninstalling it. Since there&#8217;s a perfectly legal way to access <a title="Adobe Prerelease program" href="https://www.adobe.com/cfusion/mmform/index.cfm?name=prerelease_interest" target="_blank">prerelease software</a> from Adobe, I&#8217;d like to mention it here because it seems there&#8217;s a lot of misconception and lack of information about it.

    <!--more-->If you&#8217;re into torrent downloads and warez forums, I&#8217;m fine &#8211; I used to hang there too, some years ago. But if you&#8217;re a Photoshop professional (or any other Adobe&#8217;s software user) who would like to have a look to the coming version, and maybe contribute with your suggestions and bug reports, go and apply in the official

    <a title="Adobe Prerelease Programs" href="https://www.adobe.com/cfusion/mmform/index.cfm?name=prerelease_interest" target="_blank">Adobe Prerelease Programs</a> page. It&#8217;s free, it&#8217;s legal, and fun.

    You&#8217;re required to give some basic information about yourself, nothing too personal &#8211; like how many years you&#8217;ve been in the industry, your expertise level, how much RAM your computer has, etc. Mind you, they&#8217;re looking for all kind of users with all kind of Mac/PC setup, so don&#8217;t feel intimidate if you&#8217;re just a beginner. You&#8217;re allowed to explain why you would like to join the prerelease program (and you may have some good reason to be in the number). Being an official beta tester is a privileged position!

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        You can request for features! Adobe engineers are there, listening and answering.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        You can add your voice to the group of people who dislike some new behavior (they may change it, eventually) or suggest a better one from your point of view.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        You have all the support for beta releases&#8217;Â installation and uninstallation (not a trivial task, sometimes).
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    Plus the usual stuff &#8211; contribute in the software testing and bug reporting, lurk the new stuff first and be able to ask what it&#8217;s for, be in touch with professionals around the world. Isn&#8217;t that wonderful?
  </p>

  <p>
    I can&#8217;t assure your application will be accepted, but it&#8217;s worth a try and does no harm. Go now!
