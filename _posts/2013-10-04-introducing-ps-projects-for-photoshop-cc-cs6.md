<div class="pf-content">
  <p>
    <br /> I&#8217;m glad to announce my latest script for Photoshop CC / CS6, called <strong>PS Projects</strong>.
  </p>

    What is it?

      <p>
        <span itemprop="description"><span itemprop="name">PS Projects</span> is a <span itemprop="applicationCategory">script</span> for <span itemprop="applicationSuite">Photoshop</span> CC and CS6, that lets you Create, Load and Modify Project files &#8211; i.e. collections of images in any format, from any folder in your hard drive as file references, that for some reason you might need to open in Photoshop often.</span>
      </p>
    </div>

    <div itemprop="itemReviewed" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/SoftwareApplication">
    </div>

    <div itemprop="itemReviewed" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/SoftwareApplication">
      <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2269" alt="PS Projects - Main Dialog" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/PSProjects_MainDialog.png" width="505" height="270" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/PSProjects_MainDialog.png 505w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/09/PSProjects_MainDialog-150x80.png 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/09/PSProjects_MainDialog-300x160.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 505px) 100vw, 505px" />
    </div>

    <h2>
      Do I need it?
    </h2>

    <p>
      Have you ever had the need to open the same set of images more than once, maybe because you&#8217;re a UX designer working on a project that includes dozens of assets, or a still life photographer post-producting images that the Art Director has finally chosen for the Ad campaign, from the hundreds you&#8217;ve shot in total?
    </p>

    <p>
      PS Projects implements the idea of Project Files: a lightweight, encrypted file that contains only the links to the assets you want to open in Photoshop.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/PS_Projects_Save.png" target="_blank"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2248 alignright" itemprop="image" alt="PS Projects - Save" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/PS_Projects_Save-277x300.png" width="277" height="300" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/PS_Projects_Save-277x300.png 277w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/09/PS_Projects_Save-150x161.png 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/09/PS_Projects_Save.png 516w" sizes="(max-width: 277px) 100vw, 277px" /></a>
    </p>

    <h2>
      How does it work?
    </h2>

    <p>
      <strong>Create a New Project</strong> selecting files from any folder in you hard disk, any format that PS can open: PSD, TIFF, JPG, DNG, etc. and <strong>Save</strong> a .psproject file with a meaningful name.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each time you need that very set of images, just <strong>Load</strong> the .psproject file and you&#8217;ll get them all opened in Photoshop in a glance.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Is it cool?
    </h2>

    <p itemprop="description">
      PS Projects relieves you from the need to duplicate, move or tag a selection of images that you need to pick up from the bottomless pits of your hard drives &#8211; <strong>the actual files are always kept in their original position</strong>, and you won&#8217;t risk to end up with duplicates or trashing something important.
    </p>

    <div itemprop="reviewRating" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Rating">
      <meta itemprop="ratingValue" content="5" />
    </div>

    <p>
      <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2252" itemprop="image" alt="PSProject File" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/PSProject_file.png" width="1070" height="737" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/PSProject_file.png 1070w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/09/PSProject_file-150x103.png 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/09/PSProject_file-300x206.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/09/PSProject_file-1024x705.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1070px) 100vw, 1070px" />
    </p>

    <p>
      Project files weight few Kilobytes, are portable and safe &#8211; you can basically create as many of them as you need, risk-free.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Future versions
    </h2>

    <p>
      PS Project is actively developed: just while version 1 takes off, I&#8217;m working hard on the next major release, which will be a <strong>big feature upgrade</strong>. Including a brand new &#8220;Load&#8221; dialog that allows you to:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Load</strong> files in Photoshop (as before).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Copy</strong> the referenced images to a Folder.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Apply Actions</strong> to the referenced images, with the possibility to save the result in a new location, and logging errors.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Inspect</strong> the project (referenced images list, owner, date, project version&#8230;)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Basically you&#8217;ll be able to <strong>do a lot more</strong> with the images referenced in the Project File, not only open them. By the way, version 2.0 will be a <strong>free</strong> update for licensed 1.x users. I plan to open a public beta (for certified 1.x customers) so stick around for the announce.
    </p>
