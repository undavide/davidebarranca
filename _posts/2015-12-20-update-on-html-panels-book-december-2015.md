Hello readers, I'm happy to inform you that the "Adobe Photoshop HTML Panels Development" book is in good shape! I've kept writing, even if my life by the end of the year has got pretty intense.

These days, lot of paper work for the annual taxes, lunches and dinners with family and friends, besides my postproduction and coding jobs that will run at full speed until mid-January, when I'll hopefully have some extra spare time to breathe and write at a more constant pace.

Anyway, I'd like to share with you the book's Index as it is now; most of the content is already in place, even if stuff is not yet final. I've built several demo panels (about 17 of them, and counting), which code will be available alongside with the book. TODO sections have not been written yet; I'm currently finishing chapter 13 - the book is about 190 pages so far, with code excerpts and some images.

Originally, I wanted to record a lengthy videotutorial, to be bundled with the book (as an optional purchase). I'm afraid it doesn't fit in my time schedule now, so I'll be publishing the book first, then produce the video series later in 2016 (which will be sold separately, at a discounted price for the ebook owners).

I take the chance to thank each and everyone among friends and developers (most of the time the two overlap) who's been helping me so far - I wish all the best to you and your families, see you in 2016. Ciao!
