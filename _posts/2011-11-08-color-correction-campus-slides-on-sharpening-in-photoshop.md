Since I was just a support teacher I could afford to be totally unconventional, so I tried a daring approach to the subject. If you feel brave enough to <a title="Sharpening slides (italian)" href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/CCC_DavideBarranca_Sharpening.pdf" target="_blank">download the italian slides</a> I wrote by hand withÂ <a title="Noteshelf per iPad" href="http://www.fluidtouch.biz/noteshelf/" target="_blank">Noteshelf</a>Â on my iPad, you&#8217;ll possibly have some fun too &#8211; even though I&#8217;ve been told the better part was me wandering through the class saying crazy things about sharpening techniques in Photoshop, based on the evolution of perception in human beings! Any comment (even crazy) is welcome as usual ðŸ˜‰
