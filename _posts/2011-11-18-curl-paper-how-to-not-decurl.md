    I ran into this video some years ago, and I&#8217;ve always, vividly, remembered it as one of the worst examples of a rude behavior towards an innocent print ðŸ™‚

    Actually, I&#8217;ve always considered Michael Reichmann&#8217;s <a title="Michael Reichmann Luminous Landscape website" href="http://www.luminous-landscape.com" target="_blank">Luminous Landscape</a> one of the best websites around for professionals in the photography and printing business &#8211; both for his independency and, above all, for Michael&#8217;s sober style.

    That&#8217;s the why I jumped off my chair when I saw him doing *that* to a print. Man, I could almost hear the paper&#8217;s fibers and coating groan and whimper! So when, early this week, I had to literally fight with a very large format (64&#8243; x 94&#8243;), utterly curled print (we had to momentarily switch to Hahnemuhle FineArt Baryta, since PhotoRag went <a title="Hahnemuhle changes its mind about 64â€³!" href="http://localhost:8888/2011/11/hahnemuhle-changes-its-mind-about-64/" target="_blank">temporarily out of stock</a>, being FineArt a very rigid paper), I recalled Reichmann&#8217;s performance and I showed it to the image&#8217;s author I was printing for. Our policy is to never touch the printed surface &#8211; which is quite delicate &#8211; except for micro-retouches with a fine brush and acrylic paint (we&#8217;re maniacs and paranoids, we know) so you may understand why he too opened his eyes wide just like if Michael were slapping his mother ðŸ™‚

    That said, if you&#8217;re into mothers slapping and de-curling curled papers, please find the original <a title="D-Roller product review" href="http://www.luminous-landscape.com/reviews/accessories/d-roller.shtml" target="_blank">product review</a>.

    <strong>Disclaimer</strong>: I hope you recognize here some innocent irony and a deep respect to Mr. Reichmann: I mean, I still follow his terrific website even after I&#8217;ve seen what he did to that print! ðŸ™‚
