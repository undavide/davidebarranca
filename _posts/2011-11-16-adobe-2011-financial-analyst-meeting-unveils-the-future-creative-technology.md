    Is it true that Finance rules the world now? Possibly. I&#8217;ve found more technology sneak peeks and roadmaps publicly disclosed in the <a title="Adobe Financial Analyst Meeting unveils technology plans for creatives future" href="http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/invrelations/2011_analyst_mtg/2011analystmeeting.html" target="_blank">November 2011 Adobe Financial Analyst Meeting videos</a>Â than in a 365 days collection of blogpost rumors about Photoshop, InDesign, Flash and Dreamweaver. Wow. If you&#8217;re into Adobe (whether as a creative or developer) you must see at least the first three speeches by Shantanu Narayen (Adobe CEO), Kevin Lynch (Adobe CTO) and David Wadhwani (SVP/GM Digital Media), to properly understand where Adobe is headed to, and what their software will look like, and shape the creative world, in the years to come.

    I admit I&#8217;m still a bit puzzled: Adobe is undergoing an utterly deep transformation, and it&#8217;s not clear to me whether in a direction that better fits my needs or not. Anyway, I&#8217;ll write a lot more in the future about this, so stay tuned. A brief glance of what you&#8217;ll see in the videos &#8211; I&#8217;m going to skip most of the financial stuff.

  <ul>
    <li>
      Â <a title="Shantanu Narayen speech" href="http://asib-na4.adobeconnect.com/p6ps875limb/" target="_blank">Vision and Strategy</a>: Narayen presents Adobe&#8217;s (apparently equally bipartite!) commitment to Digital Media and Digital Marketing.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a title="Kevin Lynch speech" href="http://asib-na4.adobeconnect.com/p9lzxxq132a/" target="_blank">Innovation</a>: Lynch enters the details of both worlds: Creative Services (like the recently announced Creative Cloud), Creative Community, and Creative Apps (with information about software release cycles, mobile devices, etc), plus the Marketing Cloud that I&#8217;m not interested into.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a title="David Wadhwani speech" href="http://asib2.adobeconnect.com/p90do62vlj2/" target="_blank">Digital Media Opportunity</a>: Wadhwani talks about technologies Adobe is aggressively pushing (HTML5 above all), with the help of some of the recent company&#8217;s acquisitions (like Typekit, PhoneGag), and demoes coming features in InDesign, Edge, Flash for exporting (repurposing) digital content in a large array of devices.
    </li>
  </ul>

Any comment from you is welcome as always!
