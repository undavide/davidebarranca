I don't have a Patreon page, but I've got two fairly cheap plugins on the Photoshop Marketplace, [ALCE](https://adobe.com/go/cc_plugins_discover_plugin?pluginId=28db2e07&workflow=share) (Advanced Local Contrast Enhancer) and [Double USM](https://adobe.com/go/cc_plugins_discover_plugin?pluginId=78c3cdaf&workflow=share) (on sharpening). If you happen to buy them, please leave a positive rating/review, it would greatly help. Or, you can

## Transcription

The transcripted video looks weird, but I'm told it helps to have it anyway because it's easier to translate to other languages. Apologies for the lack of punctuation and the sloppy syntax.
