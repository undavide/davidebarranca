I am starting a new series on development, called "Adobe UXP: Things you need to know" (I'm getting fancy with titles ðŸ˜Š) In my intentions it'll be very much along the lines of the old "HTML Panels Tips" series but in a different media. This first installment, a quick rundown on the news from the Adobe MAX 2020 announcement, is a 27 minutes video.

Let me know what you think: feedbacks on the series idea, about UXP, life during the pandemic.
Speaking of which: if you find this content useful, _please consider supporting me_ â€“ 2020 is a hell of a year. I don't have a Patreon page, but I've got two fairly cheap plugins on the Photoshop Marketplace, [ALCE](https://adobe.com/go/cc_plugins_discover_plugin?pluginId=28db2e07&workflow=share) (Advanced Local Contrast Enhancer) and [Double USM](https://adobe.com/go/cc_plugins_discover_plugin?pluginId=78c3cdaf&workflow=share) (on sharpening). If you happen to buy them, please leave a positive rating/review, it would greatly help. If you cannot, or don't want to, that's OK anyway.
