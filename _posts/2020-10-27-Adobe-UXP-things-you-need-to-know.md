I am starting a new series on development, called "Adobe UXP: Things you need to know" (I'm getting fancy with titles 😊) In my intentions it'll be very much along the lines of the old "HTML Panels Tips" series but in a different media. This first installment, a quick rundown on the news from the Adobe MAX 2020 announcement, is a 27 minutes video.

Let me know what you think: feedbacks on the series idea, about UXP, life during the pandemic.
Speaking of which: if you find this content useful, _please consider supporting me_ – 2020 is a hell of a year. I don't have a Patreon page, but I've got two fairly cheap plugins on the Photoshop Marketplace, [ALCE](https://adobe.com/go/cc_plugins_discover_plugin?pluginId=28db2e07&workflow=share) (Advanced Local Contrast Enhancer) and [Double USM](https://adobe.com/go/cc_plugins_discover_plugin?pluginId=78c3cdaf&workflow=share) (on sharpening). If you happen to buy them, please leave a positive rating/review, it would greatly help. Or, you can

Hey this is Davide, and the time has finally 
come to talk about UXP. So housekeeping first,  
this is not a new podcast. The world doesn't 
need a new one, but the topic - UXP the Unified  
Extensibility Platform - is so important that I 
decided to set aside the dry blog posts that I  
usually write and try with a medium that allows 
me a more extended, and probably even more  
nuanced, kind of conversation. So here I would 
like to match in UXP terms the HTML Panels  
Tips series that I had posted on my blog 
years ago, which was quite helpful I'm told.  
So my intention is to cover all the basics about 
UXP for third-party developers and in this first  
installment I would just want to introduce you to 
the big news that Adobe has dropped at MAX 2020,  
and basically answer the following questions. 
What the heck is UXP? Should I care? How to  
prepare? Can you help? Those kind of things. And 
then in the next videos, which might be videos  
or written posts I don't know yet, just leave me 
your feedback so that I know what is best for you,  
I will try to dig deeper on those subjects. But 
for the time being let's just review the big news.  
It's not really that UXP has been announced at 
MAX because it was already there in Adobe XD.  
The news is that UXP is available to third-party 
developers like me, and probably like you,  
in one of the major Creative Cloud applications: 
Photoshop 2021. I haven't even touched what UXP  
is, but you have to know that this is 
the future of extensibility for all the  
major Creative Cloud apps so after effects 
indesign illustrator and so on and so forth  
actually it is already there and this 
is being revealed by Adobe themselves  
so UXP powers internal feature development 
in addition to third-party extensibility.  
I.e Adobe is using UXP now as they were using 
CEP, the Common Extensibility Platform in the past  
to implement first-party features: for instance 
in Photoshop there's the I think it's called  
the New File dialog that was a CEP dialog and 
it has been converted now to a UXP dialog, so  
those kind of features are right now implemented 
in Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Premiere Pro  
and so on and so forth. But they are not available 
to third-party developers except for Photoshop and  
of course XD. So UXP API in Photoshop 2021, and 
in the end this is going to get almost everywhere.  
And the really important bit: UXP, the Unified 
Extensibility Platform, is going to replace CEP,  
the Common Extensibility Platform in the long run. 
So the Unified will beat the Common. But relax,  
this is not going to happen overnight. We will 
have plenty of time to learn the new thing and  
port legacy code to UXP. This is what we have 
been told over and over again. quote & quote:  
plenty of time. But we haven't been given 
any actual expiration date so right now CEP  
and UXP are co-existing in the same Photoshop. 
If you ask me what this "plenty of time" means  
well when you have plenty of something you have 
more than one unit of that something. And speaking  
of time the unit here is likely one cycle i.e one 
major version. So I would say that it is fair to  
expect that we'll have at the very least a couple 
of cycles, two years of CEP and UXP overlap. Maybe  
more. In my optimistic days I would say at least 
twice that, so four years. But let's just say  
at the very least two. And actually nobody 
really knows, this is my best guesstimate.  
So in my opinion there is no need for 
you to quit everything in your CEP  
or ExtendScript development tomorrow to start 
trying to port your production code in UXP.  
That would be in my opinion a very bad idea; 
just get your feet wet with this technology  
and keep maintaining your old code bases. 
But UXP is definitely going to be the future  
of the entire Creative Cloud extensibility. That 
said the first question that is fair to ask is:  
why, why the need of UXP? And this is a question 
that I also had. CEP was kind of stagnating in  
the last couple of years, and that was good! 
Because nothing was changing, you could just  
go on with your business, write code sell stuff. 
But it turns out that Adobe was experiencing and  
trying to react to some of the drawbacks of 
CEP, so let me try to describe them to you.  
First one is likely very well known to every 
developer: CEP is running on one engine,  
which is the JavaScript V8 engine that engine 
dialogues with the host application engine,  
which is an old and grumpy ExtendScript engine. 
So just for us to be on the same page: CEP, the  
old technology, is just an NW.js instance running 
in the host application. And NW.js is a way to  
combine the Chromium Embedded Framework or CEF 
with Node.js so basically you have a browser and  
Node.js combined. And then you write some sort of 
supercharged web application that runs within that  
context and those two. Chromium and Node are 
embedded in the host application, in my case  
Photoshop. And by the way I have a course on NW.js 
which is called JavaScript Native Applications for  
Photoshop, which is basically a way to transplant 
CEP panels outside of Photoshop as independent  
application. This is just a shameless plug, 
because it's 2020 for everybody guys... Where  
was I? With CEP you have this two different heads 
communicating and sending messages back and forth;  
so the JavaScript V8 engine of the panel sends 
scripting messages as Strings to the Photoshop  
/ host application engine which is ExtendScript 
based, then collects the return value. All this  
back and forth is not really ideal. We would like 
to have just one engine to rule them all. Second,  
every time that Chrome or Chromium or something 
like that is involved you might have experience of  
the fact that Chrome is quite resource intensive, 
it's heavy, it consumes RAM and CPU cycles.  
So you start having more than one panel open 
and running that might have a substantial  
impact on your machine and performances. And 
by the way it's not only third-party panels:  
as I said host applications are using the same 
technology to support their own native features,  
so you might have a very large number of panels 
loaded in your system and this might degrade the  
performances quite substantially. And these are 
the two main drawbacks that UXP tries to solve.  
Let me bring up this diagram here, which is quite 
scary at first, but I will try just to sum up the  
most salient parts. We have a couple of problems 
first problem the two engines and this is solved  
brilliantly killing one engine. So in UXP we 
have just one engine that deals with the UI,  
so with the panel. By the way we're not talking 
about panels anymore, this is against the  
Adobe guidelines and they are patrolling that 
quite strictly. We are talking about plugins,  
so you will be writing and developing 
UXP plugins, and a plugin can contain:  
zero or more panels; zero or more dialogues, 
which are just modal windows, modal dialogues;  
and zero or more commands, which are headless 
scripts. So if your thing doesn't really need  
a UI you're going to call that a Command now. 
So a plugin is a container of all those things  
together or just one of them. UXP plugins have 
one JavaScript V8 engine alone, and that deals  
with the scripting side as well now, so we finally 
got rid of the ExtendScript language. This is a  
huge change that has some you know pretty wild 
consequences that we will get to in a moment.  
Second problem, performances; in both CEP and 
UXP the UI that you design is built using HTML,  
CSS and JavaScript. Actually UXP allows a 
subset of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, but more  
on that in a minute. This UI is not just shown 
as rendered HTML elements in the user interface,  
instead it is parsed and then converted 
into native controls. So your, say,  
HTML button is not just displayed as CEP 
would do, but it is converted into a native  
bit of Photoshop UI, made of the same matter 
of all the rest of the native Photoshop UI.  
And this speeds up the whole interface quite a 
bit, so you are solving both CEP's main problems  
at once: the two engines and the reactivity of the 
interface / the footprint it has in your system.  
Actually there is more in this UXP umbrella 
term: besides the scripting engine with all  
the bells and whistles of modern JavaScript, the 
fat arrow syntax, object destructuring, and so on  
and so forth, we get also a common set of APIs for 
Networking, FileIO, and in the future, these are  
not yet available, Imaging and Machine Learning as 
well. Let me talk about the DOM, so the scripting  
layer. There is this massive switch to a new 
JavaScript engine and this is not a bloodless  
transition. For instance all the elements that 
were peculiar to the ExtendScript language  
are gone, like gone forever. XML literal support, 
or the ScriptUI library – those beloved ScriptUI  
windows, they cannot exist anymore. The Adobe 
team has been up to this huge task of rewiring  
all the DOM and the system is new, so let me try 
to find the right bits, you see that you require  
'photoshop', this new object is made available 
by UXP and then you go on with the dot notation,  
the app, properties and methods. But we are far 
from having a complete DOM: this is the target  
of the Photoshop team, this is what we have been 
told, but we are not there yet. Lots of things are  
missing. Fortunately Photoshop has this peculiar 
thing called ActionManager, and ActionManager lets  
you get where the DOM can't go. So you can get 
and set properties and you can perform actions.  
ActionManager is still there in UXP, it's even 
more powerful, but now it is called BatchPlay,  
and it has a new syntax which is kind of simpler, 
JSON based. You can group different actions  
in an array and run them at once, it's quite fast. 
But the underlying structure of the actual events  
and descriptors is the same. One question that 
I've been asked quite a lot is the following:  
is there a ScriptingListener plugin for 
UXP? In ActionManager that was crucial,  
so is there a BatchPlay equivalent? The good 
news is that there is, actually it's much  
better, and that's made by my friend the 
incredibly talented developer Jaroslav Bereza.  
Sounds Spanish but he's from the Czech Republic. 
The thing is called Alchemist for Photoshop  
and it's kind of an inspector and a listener 
combined, so it's much much more powerful.  
It can be found at this GitHub repo and 
recently in the UXP Marketplace as well.  
Let me rewind a bit, when I told you that you have 
just a subset of HTML, CSS and the JavaScript to  
work with: this is very very important, the most 
important takeaway here is that, I know it sounds  
silly but... UXP is not CEP. So with CEP you 
were used to this idea that you were targeting  
something like a browser, so you could access all 
the standards in the world, plus you had Node.js.  
Not the case here. And I'm not saying this to 
scare you, but just bring you to realize that UXP  
is very different. Speaking of missing elements, 
in the HTML for instance, to date, so far, there  
is no canvas element. So if you need the canvas 
to draw your fancy interfaces in the 2d context  
ah you're out of luck. Might be that the canvas 
will be introduced because of missing elements and  
API are still added so probably in a month, four 
months from now, it will be available. I cannot  
say. But to date the canvas is not yet there. And 
just to name another one, in CSS we don't have the  
float, which would sound quite you know, standard, 
but we don't have it. We have the FlexBox instead  
so we use FlexBox to architect the UI, and 
we will have the CSS Grid, we've been told,  
in the future probably somewhere in 2021. So you 
see that there are missing parts and some of them  
probably are going to be added in the future, 
some others won't, and only time will tell.  
Speaking of JavaScript and API there is no, or 
at least the last time that I've checked there  
was no, document.createevent(). And you might 
say: well, who cares, I mean that's the first  
time that I've heard about it. Turns out that 
document.createevent() is something that Vue.js,  
the latest version of Vue.js heavily relies 
upon, and if you don't have a createevent Vue.js  
will not work, I have been told that createevent 
might be shimmed, I've not been able to do that,  
but I'm told that it can be done, so probably 
Vue.js, if properly massaged, will work  
but these are the kind of things that you have to 
deal with. So forget about CEP as this beautiful  
large body of standards, we are dealing with 
a much smaller playground here. And this is  
also the reason why if you're serious about 
UXP plugin creation you should learn React,  
because React.js is the JavaScript framework that 
Adobe itself uses to build their own plugins, and  
it works because somehow UXP is shaped to 
make it work. So if there's something in UXP  
that is missing to make React work properly, 
engineers will implement it so you can be  
sure that React is going to work. If you want to 
plug in something else you might be lucky, you  
might not. What else comes from MAX 2020, there 
is this new way to deploy and look for plugins,  
let me talk about the deployment first. We are 
happily abandoning the ZXP format hallelujah  
and we are embracing something called CCX. And 
this is very simple, it's just a matter of zipping  
the plugin folder, no signature, no timestamp, and 
then you rename the ZIP to CCX, upload it to the  
developer console and submit it to the Marketplace 
or distribute it to your channels. The CCX  
when the user double clicks it is going to be 
opened by the Creative Cloud desktop application  
that performs the installation. In the Creative 
Cloud desktop app there's this Marketplace tab,  
here I've selected all plugins and filtered 
for Photoshop plugins. All these entries are  
new UXP plugins these have been made in the 
last months this is mine this is mine too  
all the rest below this available from Adobe 
exchange is basically the old CEP Marketplace.  
Now let me get to Photoshop where there's this 
new Plugins menu item, and you have a few things  
in here: first you can browse for plugins, and 
this brings up the Creative Cloud application,  
or you can launch your plugins panels. This is 
where your licensed plugins belong. These are my  
four ones and this is just a development thing. 
Then you click herem and then you have all those  
commands that are the same that belong to this 
menu here, so this is the panel, and then you  
see you have other entries like About, and About 
is a modal dialog, right, and you have the panel,  
the modal dialog, and as I said there are other 
things that could be there for instance Commands:  
scripts that you can run. Also please know that 
CEP panels now are in this Extensions Legacy,  
a name that some developers haven't liked too 
much. But anyways... Plugins are the new UXP thing  
and then Extension Legacy is the place where all 
CEP panels belong. So what else, okay, tooling oh  
well this is good, this is cool! We now have this 
thing called the Adobe UXP Developer Tool which is  
really helpful. You can add existing plugins, 
for instance like this one, you just load the  
manifest.json and well the plugin already exists 
so we can dismiss this. And you can load, reload,  
watch the folder, so that the UXP Developers Tool 
reloads each time that you change the source code  
and also debug. And this opens this kind of Chrome 
Developers Tool window which is not really a match  
features-wise with the real Chrome Developers Tool 
but you know it's useful. You have the console,  
you can look for elements and so on and so forth. 
And you can look at the logs and you can also  
package directly from the UXP Developers Tool, so 
create the CCX file here, and then you have other  
things. So this is really handy and completely 
new and it helps a lot in creating UXP plugins.  
And you can also create a new plugin from the UXP 
Developers Tool, so this pops up a dialogue where  
you can enter the name, the id, version, so on 
so forth and also select template. And you have  
a couple of them, one is called ps-starter, 
and then we have this ps-react-starter  
so you can think about those UXP plugin as 
you know a simple one and the complex one.  
I have them both so let me close this and get 
back to that. There's this one called Theme  
Switcher which is, let me show that to you because 
it's fun, the simplest thing ever. It's just four  
buttons and an icon and then you can change 
the UI brightness of the Photoshop interface.  
And by the way you see that you you have this 
possibility to keep the panel appearance in sync,  
and this is done not via JavaScript as in CEé but 
with Media Queries. This is quite simple you see  
there is an index.html, css and JavaScript and the 
manifest. Manifest is really important, this is  
where all the properties of the products are set 
so the id, the name, the width, height, preferred  
width and height, max width and height, icons 
and stuff. And then you have the plugins that use  
Eeact such as ALCE, which is here let me show that 
to you as well. This one is quite more complex you  
see you have tooltips, sliders, buttons, and 
whatnot. And in case of a more complex UI,  
and this is not complex at all in absolute terms 
but it's more complex that this four button guy  
here, you should really use React and in fact 
you see all the usual React Garbage and in fact  
you see all the usual React stuff. I have a bunch 
of components, css, controller, JavaScript files,  
and the ubiquitous manifest.json which is 
here. As a code editor you can use whatever  
editor you want, I use Visual Studio Code, it's 
just handier for me because I also need it for  
ExtendScript code, because remember you can still 
use ExtendScript: those things are coexisting.  
Now, in my case I'm running macOS Catalina so 
I don't have access to the ExtendScript ToolKit  
anymore, and I have to use the plugin for Visual 
Studio Code. One last thing that I want to mention  
in this introduction is, let me bring back Chrome, 
here is the Spectrum Web Components. So when you  
build a UI for Photoshop UXP panels or dialogues 
you have access to Spectrum Web Components, those  
sp- things you have sp-button, sp-dropdown and 
so on so forth, and in this website you have a  
bunch of them. Mind you, not all of them have been 
implemented in UXP, we have just a limited set by  
now, but the support is growing with time. So for 
instance we don't still have the Switch I think,  
which is here, I would have needed that but 
I'm told that this is going to be available  
in the future. So you can use this website as a 
reference. Please note that if you Google Adobe  
Spectrum, Spectrum is a design system that Adobe 
has been working on for quite some time, you can  
find several different things. On the one side 
you find the Spectrum specs, so this is just you  
know the theoretical design system, and then you 
have the Spectrum CSS which is of course the CSS  
implementation of that design system, but I don't 
think they are really functional so for instance  
in the Spectrum CSS I don't think, I might be 
wrong but I don't think you can open a drop down  
menu you just have the design of that element. 
And then you have the Spectrum Web Components that  
we have seen in UXP but you also have something 
called Coral Spectrum which is by Adobe as well  
and these two are a web components implementation 
of the Spectrum design system but it's a different  
implementation of the first Spectrum 
Web Components, that's kind of strange.  
And then eventually you have React Spectrum 
which is the React components implementation  
of that so, be aware that in the context of UXP 
plugins Spectrum Web Components are the ones made  
available by default by UXP, so you can add for 
instance an sp-button. Let me show that to you  
where's the button here you can add an sp-button 
and that is going to appear in your UXP plugin no  
need to import anything. You could also use native 
components, let me bring up this plugin here  
you can use native elements they're not very fancy 
looking, so for instance this is the range, the  
slider, native range, whereas we have the Spectrum 
slider here which is kind of nicer. So you should  
use Spectrum components where possible because 
this will keep the look consistent and they are  
keeping refining those components over and over 
as opposed to these dull native elements you know.  
I think that's it for this not so brief overview 
of the main highlights of the UXP announcement  
so let me try to sum up what I've covered here. 
So UXP is going to be the future of all Adobe  
Creative Cloud extensibility. CEP is going 
to be faded out, it will take a lot of time,  
nobody knows how long. UXP has one engine compared 
to the two engines of the CEP system, the one  
engine deals with both the UI and the scripting 
side so we have an entirely new scripting engine  
that has a new DOM. You can use subset HTML, 
CSS and JavaScript and the result of what you  
write is then converted into native controls 
which are faster and have a lighter footprint.  
We have common APIs for Networking, FileIO and 
in the future Imaging and Machine Learning,  
so this is really exciting. We also have a 
new set of tools, UXP Developer Tool and the  
possibility to create either simple vanilla 
plugins or more complex ones based on React.  
we've got a new Marketplace and a simpler 
installation via CCS that is more reliable  
than ZXP, if it was less reliable that would have 
come really as a surprise, and the entire UXP  
experience is driven by the Creative Cloud 
desktop app. In the end, if you ask me, I am  
quite pleased by the change. I had my problems 
with it because I i hate change in general  
but in the end I think that this is going to 
bring more positive sides than negative. It is,  
compared to CEP but I don't want to sound rude in 
that, but UXP sounds more like a super-polished  
modern version of ScriptUI rather than a big 
step into the standards direction, and this  
is more of a closed system but we have to play 
into this smaller frame that Adobe is drawing.  
That said you can find in this blog post of mine 
all the links to the available documentation that  
Adobe is currently working on, and they're 
doing a pretty good job, and by the way let  
me thank all the people in the Adobe teams that 
have been supporting us third-party developers  
for the MAX 2020 launch. I do plan to cover all 
the topics that I've just briefly touched here  
in future videos, blog posts, audio I don't know 
just let me know what you think and what would be  
best for you, and feel free to ask questions and 
suggest topics: I'll be happy to give you answers,  
if I have them. If you have enjoyed this please 
consider supporting me: 2020 is a hell of a year,  
I don't have any Patreon page but 
besides my Adobe development content,  
you can find in the UXP Marketplace there are 
two plugins of mine: ALCE, the advanced local  
contrast enhancer or DoubleUSM about sharpening. 
They're for sale half of the regular price,  
they're 16 bucks now and if you happen to buy 
them please leave a positive rating or review,  
that would greatly help. If you cannot 
or don't want to, that's okay anyway.  
All right thank you for watching and 
see you in the next one. Stay safe! Bye.
