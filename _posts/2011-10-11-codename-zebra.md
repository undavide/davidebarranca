    <img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-75" title="zebra" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/zebra.jpg" alt="Codename: ZEBRA" width="480" height="337" />I&#8217;m currently involved in a particularly challenging prepress job for a particularly prestigious publishing house, facing an astonishingly close deadline (kind of: has to be printed&#8230; yesterday). The good part is that I&#8217;ve managed to gather around it some of my best friends &#8211; who, by chance, are among the most talented retouchers in the country. I promise, if we&#8217;ll survive, I&#8217;ll tell you the whole story. In the meantime let me introduce you codename ZEBRA project&#8217;s team: <a title="Marco Olivotto" href="www.marcoolivotto.com" target="_blank">MO</a>, <a title="Marco Diodato, aka Master Disaster" href="http://www.marcodiodato.com" target="_blank">MD</a>, <a title="Tiziano Fruet" href="http://www.cygnusdesign.eu/" target="_blank">TF</a>Â and yours truly, aka the NWA (no weekend allowed) guys.
