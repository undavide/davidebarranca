![Codename: ZEBRA](/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/zebra.jpg "zebra")

I'm currently involved in a particularly challenging prepress job for a particularly prestigious publishing house, facing an astonishingly close deadline (kind of: has to be printed... yesterday). The good part is that I've managed to gather around it some of my best friends - who, by chance, are among the most talented retouchers in the country.

I promise, if we'll survive, I'll tell you the whole story. In the meantime let me introduce you codename ZEBRA project's team: [MO](www.marcoolivotto.com "Marco Olivotto"), [MD](http://www.marcodiodato.com "Marco Diodato, aka Master Disaster"), [TF](http://www.cygnusdesign.eu/ "Tiziano Fruet")Â and yours truly, aka the NWA (no weekend allowed) guys.
