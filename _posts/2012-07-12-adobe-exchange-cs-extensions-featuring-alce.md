Quoting the official website:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      The new AdobeÂ® Exchange is a Creative SuiteÂ® extension marketplace. It is available as a panel within a variety of CS6 applications. The Adobe Exchange panel provides a new way to search, discover, and install plug-ins, extensions, and other content for Creative Suite products. With this preview of the Adobe Exchange panel, you can browse through items that are available for your CS6 applications; download and install those items; and update acquired items when new versions are available.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Developers of Creative Suite extensions can now reach a great deal of new customers via the Exchange panel: that opens directly within any major CS application (including among others Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator, Dreamweaver, Fireworks, Premiere, etc) and allows in-app buy. Users can search and navigate through extensions (either free and paid), read reviews, download trials if available. The buy is managed within Exchange &#8211; which relies on FastSpring servers for the e-commerce side &#8211; and the product is downloaded and installed via Adobe Extension Manager &#8211; and you&#8217;re ready to go!<br /> <!--more-->

    <br /> An <a title="Adobe Exchange Producer Portal" href="https://www.adobeexchange.com/producer" target="_blank">Adobe Exchange Producer Portal</a>Â for developers lets them submit new products and control sells in quite a streamlined fashion &#8211; it looks like a modern, much more efficient evolution of the Adobe Marketplace.
