  <p>
    The support of <strong>Flash</strong> panels has been officially dropped with the release or <a title="Photoshop CC 2014 new features" href="https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/whats-new.html" target="_blank">Photoshop CC 2014</a> (internal version: 15.0) &#8211; meaning that in order to be compatible with it, Extensions must have been ported to <strong>HTML</strong>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Which I did for all my panels! They are now <strong>CC 2014 compatible</strong> &#8211; while scripts don&#8217;t need refactoring:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a title="ALCE" href="http://www.cs-extensions.com/products/alce/" target="_blank">ALCE</a> &#8211; Advanced Local Contrast Enhancer (HTML Panel)

      <a title="Floating Adjustments" href="http://www.cs-extensions.com/products/floatingadjustments/" target="_blank">Floating Adjustments</a> (HTML Panel)

  </ul>
  
  <p>
    Please find the updated installer (log in the <a title="Adobe Add-ons" href="https://creative.adobe.com/addons/producers/5462" target="_blank">Adobe Add-ons</a> page if you&#8217;ve bought via Adobe Exchange, or in the <a title="Bigano e-store" href="https://store.bigano.com" target="_blank">Bigano e-store</a> if you&#8217;ve bought from him).

    A couple of notes:
  </p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Adobe Configurator</strong> is now useless, since it was an AIR app outputting Flash panels. There&#8217;s no Adobe&#8217;s HTML replacement planned, nor a migration tool for existing panels (you can go banging fists on table in the forums, or embrace the new SDK if you want / feel inclined). I&#8217;ve been experimenting with <strong>templates</strong> targeted to non-coders, that would ideally need just some minor tweaking. I know there is also somebody else (also third party) fiddling with the idea of an HTML Configurator. Don&#8217;t hold your breath, but it might be that in the future something will appear.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a title="CPT - Channel Power Tools" href="http://www.cs-extensions.com/products/cpt/" target="_blank">CPT</a> (Channel Power Tools) and <a title="False Profile" href="http://www.cs-extensions.com/products/falseprofile/" target="_blank">False Profile</a> &#8211; two extensions made by the great <a title="Giuliana Abbiati" href="http://www.cromaline.net" target="_blank">Giuliana Abbiati</a> &#8211; have not been ported yet since she&#8217;s been busy with the HTML version of Dan Margulis <a title="PPW - Picture Postcard Workflow panel" href="http://www.moderncolorworkflow.com/free-resources" target="_blank">PPW Panel</a>. I&#8217;ll be happy to disclose information about the timeframe as soon as I have them.
