  <p>
    My fulltime job is Post-Production, most of the time for an artist in the Contemporary Art Photography business. Weird niche in many ways, must I say after several years spent working in the field. I&#8217;ve noticed, switching in and out different, collateral projects (mainly pre-press consultancy for art publishing companies) that it requires really peculiar skills, both in the communication and technical sides.

    In the last few weeks I came up with the decision to work less and stay closer to my family (facing a tough period due to some health issues), so I&#8217;ve had to switch in stand-by many secondary projects: it&#8217;s probably a good time to start a post series on my thoughts about the Post Producer perspective in the curious, fascinating and definitely foolish business of Contemporary Art Photography. Stay tuned!
