If you've ever wanted a field guide to UXP, this is it. It's titled "UXP Landscape Guide: mapping your learning journey through Adobe Extensibility".

This one is a longer (~40 min) presentation which goal is to give a sense of what UXP is all about. Mostly to inform the learning journey of people approaching it for the first time, with just a vague idea of the territory’s shape.
I’m going through a bit of history, the tech stack, the rationale, the possibilities, stuff to master, stuff to know something about, stuff to stay away from, resources, etc.
