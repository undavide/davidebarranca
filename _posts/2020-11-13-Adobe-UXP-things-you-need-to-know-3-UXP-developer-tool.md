I don't have a Patreon page, but I've got two fairly cheap plugins on the Photoshop Marketplace, [ALCE](https://adobe.com/go/cc_plugins_discover_plugin?pluginId=28db2e07&workflow=share) (Advanced Local Contrast Enhancer) and [Double USM](https://adobe.com/go/cc_plugins_discover_plugin?pluginId=78c3cdaf&workflow=share) (on sharpening). If you happen to buy them, please leave a positive rating/review, it would greatly help. Or, you can
