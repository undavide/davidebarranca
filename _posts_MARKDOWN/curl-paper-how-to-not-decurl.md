I ran into this video some years ago, and I've always, vividly, remembered it as one of the worst examples of a rude behavior towards an innocent print :) \[caption id="attachment_315" align="aligncenter" width="430" caption="Click to play the video on a new window"\][![D-Roller video](http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/D-Roller_video.jpg "D-Roller video")](http://luminous-landscape.com/video_journal/QT_movs/LLVJ-16/Deroller.mp4 "Michael Reichmann de-curling a print")\[/caption\] Actually, I've always considered Michael Reichmann's [Luminous Landscape](http://www.luminous-landscape.com "Michael Reichmann Luminous Landscape website") one of the best websites around for professionals in the photography and printing business - both for his independency and, above all, for Michael's sober style.  That's the why I jumped off my chair when I saw him doing \*that\* to a print. Man, I could almost hear the paper's fibers and coating groan and whimper! So when, early this week, I had to literally fight with a very large format (64" x 94"), utterly curled print (we had to momentarily switch to Hahnemuhle FineArt Baryta, since PhotoRag went [temporarily out of stock](http://localhost:8888/2011/11/hahnemuhle-changes-its-mind-about-64/ "Hahnemuhle changes its mind about 64â€³!"), being FineArt a very rigid paper), I recalled Reichmann's performance and I showed it to the image's author I was printing for. Our policy is to never touch the printed surface - which is quite delicate - except for micro-retouches with a fine brush and acrylic paint (we're maniacs and paranoids, we know) so you may understand why he too opened his eyes wide just like if Michael were slapping his mother :) That said, if you're into mothers slapping and de-curling curled papers, please find the original [product review](http://www.luminous-landscape.com/reviews/accessories/d-roller.shtml "D-Roller product review"). **Disclaimer**: I hope you recognize here some innocent irony and a deep respect to Mr. Reichmann: I mean, I still follow his terrific website even after I've seen what he did to that print! :)
