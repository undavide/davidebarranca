Interface
---------

Let's have a look at the important features of VitaminBW - it's a matter of selecting few options and start the processing. ![Vitamin BW](http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/VitaminBW.jpg)

1\. Conversion
--------------

This is where VitaminBW applies its peculiar routine: you can select the **Default** conversion checkbox, or try the **Boost** option for a bit of extra punch.

2\. BW Filters
--------------

Simulating actual colored filters in BW Photography, to tweak the tonal rendering. See [here](http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/BWFilters_chart.png "BW Filters conversion table") for a conversion table.

3\. Tint
--------

Besides the **Neutral** option, you can choose between **Warm**, **Cool** and **Mixed** (i.e. warm in the highlights and cool in the shadows).

4\. Preview
-----------

VitaminBW provides you with two preview images (Harbor, Woman) you can test the different Conversion, BW Filters and Tint combinations against. The Preview checkbox toggles the original color version.

5\. Process - Single Tone
-------------------------

![SingleTone](http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/SingleTone.png)The Single Tone button starts the processing - that is, the conversion to black and white according to the VitaminBW peculiar routine, BW Filtering and toning. As a result you get a **Group** in the Layers palette, containing from top to bottom:

*   Tint layer
*   Conversion layer
*   Flat layer

All these layers are kept to give you some extra control over the result (nonetheless, if you're OK with it **just flatten** the Group and call quit). Let's review how you can tweak them! Mind you, the following steps are totally **optional**.

### Tint layer

This is what affects the toning (Neutral, Cool, Warm, Mixed). The layer is in **Color** blending mode, **50% opacity** so there's room to either: saturate the result, raising the layer's opacity; making it more subtle, lowering the layer's opacity.

### Conversion layer

Contains the peculiar VitaminBW conversion routine, and it's provided with a blank layer mask. You can paint black in the layer mask to erase the contrast effect if needed - for instance in case the Boost option has introduced some unwanted halos.

### Flat layer

This is a dull conversion, part of which is revealed only if you paint black the Conversion layer mask. Most of the time you can safely ignore it.

6\. Triple Tone
---------------

If you're inclined to experimentation try the Triple Tone, it'll be fun! What this option does is to **run three times the routine**, applying the Conversion and Tint you've chosen, but selecting different BW Filters: one time **Normal**, one time **Blue**, one time **Orange**. As a result you end up with three VitaminBW layer groups - which different tonal rendering you can apply enabling their layer masks and painting in. The following illustration opens the first time you run Triple Tone. ![TripleToneInstruction](http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/TripleToneInstruction.png) True, you can always perform the same three-times routine manually with custom filters, but usually the Normal/Orange/Blue combination is very effective and it was worth implementing as a single button.
