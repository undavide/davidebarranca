![CPT - Channel Power Tools](http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/CPT_CC.jpg) I'm happy to report that my dear friend and talented coder Giuliana Abbiati aka [Cromaline](http://www.cromaline.net "Giuliana ") has just updated to version 1.1.3 her amazing Photoshop extension _CPT - Channel Power Tools_. in order to support Photoshop CC. If you've never used it, CTP is the the Swiss Army knife of Channels Operations (channel chops anyone?), with **on-the-fly application of Channels from any colorspace** (HSB/HSL and Bogus Black included) and **live preview and composite generation** of RGB-CMYK-Lab channels. Did I mention that is freaking fast? Well, it is. To keep herself busy, Cromaline is also the software architect of Dan Margulis' [Modern Photoshop Color Workflow](http://www.moderncolorworkflow.com "Buy Dan Margulis' book website") book companion [PPW Panel for Photoshop](http://www.ledet.com/margulis/ppw "Dan Margulis free PPW panel") \- that she managed to fill up with fine scripts and smart user interfaces. CPT - Channel Power Tools for Photoshop CC is available for sale through [Adobe Exchange](#) and the [Bigano store](https://store.bigano.com/index.php/en).
