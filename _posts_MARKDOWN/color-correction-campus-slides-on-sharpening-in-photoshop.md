[![CCC Bologna 2011 - slides sullo Sharpening](http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/CCC-BO_Sharpening.jpg)](http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/CCC_DavideBarranca_Sharpening.pdf "CCC Bologna 2011 - Davide Barranca, Sharpening") The [lecture about sharpening](http://localhost:8888/2011/09/sharpening-session-at-ccc/ "Sharpening session at CCC") I did last October for the Color Correction Campus went apparently so well that I've decided to share the slides I've shown. Since I was just a support teacher I could afford to be totally unconventional, so I tried a daring approach to the subject. If you feel brave enough to [download the italian slides](http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/CCC_DavideBarranca_Sharpening.pdf "Sharpening slides (italian)") I wrote by hand with [Noteshelf](http://www.fluidtouch.biz/noteshelf/ "Noteshelf per iPad") on my iPad, you'll possibly have some fun too - even though I've been told the better part was me wandering through the class saying crazy things about sharpening techniques in Photoshop, based on the evolution of perception in human beings! Any comment (even crazy) is welcome as usual ;)
