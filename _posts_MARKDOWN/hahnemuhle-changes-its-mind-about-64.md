After a short while from the decision to drop 64" production in the DFA (Digital Fine Art) line of papers, which caused a lot of buzz in the business, [Hahnemuhle](http://www.hahnemuehle.com/site/en/210/digital-fineart.html "Hahnemuhle DFA papers") has changed its mind. With an official communication, they state that they're going to discontinue only FineArt Baryta 64" in 2012. Here's the original letter they wrote.

> Dear customers, according to new market development and the positive trend of large fine art format printing we have decided NOT to eliminate all 64” rolls from our DFA range. Following fine art papers will remain on our stock in 64” as standard articles: - Photo Rag Baryta 315, 64” Ref. 10 643 199 - Photo Rag US 305, 64” Ref. 10 643 277 Only FineArt Baryta 325, 64”, Ref. 10 643 477 will be discontinued next year. According to our actual stock level we are supposed to have the product till February on 64” format, so that you can still order this product (as long as stock lasts).

I'm very happy to hear such a good news - even though I'm a bit skeptical about the "positive trend" they mention: it looks like a nice way to admit an error and apologize. Hahnemuhle, you're welcome!
