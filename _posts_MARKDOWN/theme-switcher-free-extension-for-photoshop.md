It's now available through [Adobe Exchange](www.adobeexchange.com "Adobe Exchange") my latest, and most minimal so far, free extension for Photoshop called Theme Switcher. It simply lets you pick up the GUI Theme (that is: the Photoshop _interface color_, which since CS6 goes from Original to Light Gray, Medium Gray and Dark Gray) with one click - handy little panel that eliminates the need to dig into the Preferences. Please find the [Exchange page here](http://adobeexchange.com/store/products/919#.UXZ3eyuG3pg "Theme Switcher on Adobe Exchange") and the product page on my commercial website [CS-Extensions](http://www.cs-extensions.com/theme-switcher/ ‎ "Theme Switcher on cs-extensions.com"). If you happen to like it, please leave a review or some stars along your way!  ![Theme Switcher PS](http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/ThemeSwitcher_PS.jpg)
