![Adobe Exchange - ALCE](http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/ALCE.png "Adobe Exchange - ALCE")Today Adobe has released in the Adobe Labs a [preview of the new Adobe Exchange](http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/exchange/ "Adobe Exchange preview on Adobe Labs")! Quoting the official website:

> The new Adobe® Exchange is a Creative Suite® extension marketplace. It is available as a panel within a variety of CS6 applications. The Adobe Exchange panel provides a new way to search, discover, and install plug-ins, extensions, and other content for Creative Suite products. With this preview of the Adobe Exchange panel, you can browse through items that are available for your CS6 applications; download and install those items; and update acquired items when new versions are available.

Developers of Creative Suite extensions can now reach a great deal of new customers via the Exchange panel: that opens directly within any major CS application (including among others Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator, Dreamweaver, Fireworks, Premiere, etc) and allows in-app buy. Users can search and navigate through extensions (either free and paid), read reviews, download trials if available. The buy is managed within Exchange - which relies on FastSpring servers for the e-commerce side - and the product is downloaded and installed via Adobe Extension Manager - and you're ready to go! An [Adobe Exchange Producer Portal](https://www.adobeexchange.com/producer "Adobe Exchange Producer Portal") for developers lets them submit new products and control sells in quite a streamlined fashion - it looks like a modern, much more efficient evolution of the Adobe Marketplace. That said, I'm proud and excited to inform you that RBG - the Roberto Bigano Group is there, with four extensions coded by the wonderful [Giuly Abbiati](http://cromaline.net/ "Giuliana Abbiati") and me!
