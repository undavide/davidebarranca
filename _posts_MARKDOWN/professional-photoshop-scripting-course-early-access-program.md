I'm glad to announce that I have opened the _Early Access Program_ to my new and very much awaited **Professional Photoshop Scripting** course! Read along. The course that I have [announced](http://localhost:8888/2017/08/photoshop-scripting-course-update-august-2017/) in the past is now near completion: I would say 3/4 of the topics that I plan to cover have been written and edited – I'm at page 339 and counting! It took me way more than expected, though. [![](http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/PSScriptingCover-light-638x700.png)](https://www.ps-scripting.com)

Early Access Program
--------------------

In a fashion that is nowadays quite common among technical writers, I have opened what is referred to as an_ "Early Access Program"_. If you're not familiar with it, the idea is that you are able to read the book as I finish writing it. The advantages:

*   You don't have to wait for the final book to get started.
*   You'll be sent a notification and download link as soon as further updates are ready (new Chapters, fixes, etc).
*   You can get the course at a ludicrously discounted price now, compared to book's street price when it'll be published.
*   You can contribute to the writing process with suggestions and feedback.

Sounds good?

Full Course and Pricing
-----------------------

This one will follow exactly the same price/bundle scheme of my previous [Adobe Photoshop HTML Panels Development](http://htmlpanelsbook.com/) course.

### The F**inal Product**:

*   Final Book + Code, **$149**
*   Final Book + Videos + Code, **$249**
*   Final Book + Videos + Code (Team/Enterprise License), **$499**

### Early Access Program (current)

*   Early Access Book + Code, **$99**
*   Early Access Book + Code (Team/Enterprise License), **$199**
*   Discount Coupon for the Videos when they will be recorded

To be clear, the Early Access Program entitles you to all the work-in-progress updates, and the Final Release version too. Since I will record the videos when the book is completed, you'll have access the video content as an optional upgrade.
