> The extension does not contain valid signature. The extension will not be installed.

  If you've run into this error message while trying to install a Photoshop CS5 / CS5.5 extension on a Mac (Lion - 10.7.2), be aware that this is an Adobe Extension Manager CS5 / CS5.5 known bug. Adobe will soon release an update, in the meantime they've provided a [temporary fix](http://blogs.adobe.com/cssdk/2011/10/fix-for-extension-signature-bug-on-mac-os-10-7.html "Extensions not installing in Mac OS 10.7"). A full [thread in Adobe Forum](http://forums.adobe.com/message/3915578 "Adobe Forum thread") is available as well. By the way, an interesting MAX 2011 archive video called [How to Develop and Monetize your Creative Suite Extensions](https://max.adobe.com/schedule/by-session/how-to-develop-and-monetize-your-creative-suite-extensions/S3560 "MAX 2011 video on CS SDK") has been published, with sneak peeks of the CS SDKs future by product manager Gabriel Tavridis - get a look at it!
