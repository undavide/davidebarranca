http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EYZNU6gAZw I'm glad to announce my latest script for Photoshop CC / CS6, called **PS Projects**.

What is it?
-----------

PS Projects is a script for Photoshop CC and CS6, that lets you Create, Load and Modify Project files - i.e. collections of images in any format, from any folder in your hard drive as file references, that for some reason you might need to open in Photoshop often.

Do I need it?
-------------

Have you ever had the need to open the same set of images more than once, maybe because you're a UX designer working on a project that includes dozens of assets, or a still life photographer post-producting images that the Art Director has finally chosen for the Ad campaign, from the hundreds you've shot in total?

PS Projects implements the idea of Project Files: a lightweight, encrypted file that contains only the links to the assets you want to open in Photoshop.

How does it work?
-----------------

**Create a New Project** selecting files from any folder in you hard disk, any format that PS can open: PSD, TIFF, JPG, DNG, etc. and **Save** a .psproject file with a meaningful name.

Each time you need that very set of images, just **Load** the .psproject file and you'll get them all opened in Photoshop in a glance.

Is it cool?
-----------

PS Projects relieves you from the need to duplicate, move or tag a selection of images that you need to pick up from the bottomless pits of your hard drives - **the actual files are always kept in their original position**, and you won't risk to end up with duplicates or trashing something important.

Project files weight few Kilobytes, are portable and safe - you can basically create as many of them as you need, risk-free.

Future versions
---------------

PS Project is actively developed: just while version 1 takes off, I'm working hard on the next major release, which will be a **big feature upgrade**. Including a brand new "Load" dialog that allows you to:

*   **Load** files in Photoshop (as before).
*   **Copy** the referenced images to a Folder.
*   **Apply Actions** to the referenced images, with the possibility to save the result in a new location, and logging errors.
*   **Inspect** the project (referenced images list, owner, date, project version...)

Basically you'll be able to **do a lot more** with the images referenced in the Project File, not only open them. By the way, version 2.0 will be a **free** update for licensed 1.x users. I plan to open a public beta (for certified 1.x customers) so stick around for the announce.
