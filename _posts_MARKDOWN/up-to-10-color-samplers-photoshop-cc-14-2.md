Thanks to last Photoshop World [Codeathon](http://blogs.adobe.com/photoshopdotcom/2013/10/engineers-live-code-customer-requested-features-at-photoshop-world.html "Photoshop Codeathon)") in Las Vegas, we've finally broken the 4 Color Samplers limit in the Info Palette - we're allowed to scatter up to 10 of them like a machine gun (provided we've Photoshop CC updated to the 14.2 dot release, available from Jan 16, 2014 onwards). If you're in the color correction business, that is a big deal. \[Fireworks popping, people getting naked, etc\] Now, to be fair, this is a _pretty old_ feature request (ignored/postponed...) - something more like a JDI if you will. But let's not be the usual mumbling guys for a little bit! Just a little bit ;-) PS I built an experimental Panel back in 2011, called [Power Info Palette](http://blog.rbg.bigano.com/2011/05/22/work-in-progress-power-info-palette/ "Power Info Palette") \- which still shows that there's always room for improvement! But it's definitely nice to have native support for 10 samplers in PS now.
