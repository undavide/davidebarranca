My fulltime job is Post-Production, most of the time for an artist in the Contemporary Art Photography business. Weird niche in many ways, must I say after several years spent working in the field. I've noticed, switching in and out different, collateral projects (mainly pre-press consultancy for art publishing companies) that it requires really peculiar skills, both in the communication and technical sides. In the last few weeks I came up with the decision to work less and stay closer to my family (facing a tough period due to some health issues), so I've had to switch in stand-by many secondary projects: it's probably a good time to start a post series on my thoughts about the Post Producer perspective in the curious, fascinating and definitely foolish business of Contemporary Art Photography. Stay tuned!
