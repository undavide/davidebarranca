Are you looking for Photoshop Extensions? I'm pleased to announce that [CS Extensions](http://www.cs-extensions.com "CS Extensions - Photoshop extensions for Creatives and Retouchers"), a brand new website entirely dedicated to Adobe Photoshop CS6 script and panels, is finally online (a project that kept me quite busy in the last two months).

CS Extensions collects both paid and free 5 star extensions that my talented friend Giuly "[Cromaline](http://www.cromaline.net "Cromaline")" Abbiati and I have been building recently. Few highlights:

1.  Sneak peek of [**Double USM**](http://www.cs-extensions.com/double-usm-unsharp-mask/ "Double USM extension for Photoshop CS6"), my new Photoshop extension about advanced sharpening techniques.
2.  **Adobe Exchange** ready (the new in-app, app-store for Creative Suite Extensions).
3.  Plenty of **learning resources** links and products specification.
4.  **Updated news** about the Extensions ecosystem (releases, updates, platform bugs, etc.)

Have a look at [CS Extensions](http://www.cs-extensions.com "CS Extensions - Photoshop extensions for Creatives and Retouchers")Â to find out more! I'm still tweaking it so there's room for improvement. Leave a [feedback](http://www.cs-extensions.com/support/#general "CS Extensions feedback") there if you're willing to make your voice heard!
