![VitaminBW](http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/VitaminBW.png) Vitamin BW idea is to give you few but powerful options for Black & White conversion in three main areas - Contrast, Toning and BW Color Filters.

### Smart Contrast Enhancement

Vitamin BW features a very effective routine to boost the 3D look of your images: you can choose from the **Default** parameter, or **Boost** (for a bit of extra punch).

### Toning

Besides the default **Neutral** option, you can have a **Cool** and **Warm** toning, or an extra **Mixed** version which uses the Cool tone in the Shadows and Warm in the Highlights. The toning is on a separate layer that you can always switch on/off, or lower/raise its opacity for a milder/stronger effect.

### BW Color Filters

Way way back in time, thousands of years ago, people of my age used to shoot BW film putting some colored glass in front of the lens, like **Yellow**, **Orange**, **Red**, **Green** or **Blue** filters. We read in papyrus rolls that this way some light's wavelengths were blocked: provided you knew your Egyptian, light theory and remember to bring filters with you in the field, you sometimes ended up with better pictures using the right filter on the right subject.
