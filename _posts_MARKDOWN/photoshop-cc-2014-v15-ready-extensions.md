The support of **Flash** panels has been officially dropped with the release or [Photoshop CC 2014](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/whats-new.html "Photoshop CC 2014 new features") (internal version: 15.0) - meaning that in order to be compatible with it, Extensions must have been ported to **HTML**. Which I did for all my panels! They are now **CC 2014 compatible** \- while scripts don't need refactoring:

*   [ALCE](http://www.cs-extensions.com/products/alce/ "ALCE") \- Advanced Local Contrast Enhancer (HTML Panel)
*   [Double USM](http://www.cs-extensions.com/products/doubleusm/ "Double USM") (Script)
*   [VitaminBW](http://www.cs-extensions.com/products/vitaminbw/ "Vitamin BW") (Script)
*   [PS-Projects](http://www.cs-extensions.com/products/psprojects/ "PS Projects") (Script)
*   [Floating Adjustments](http://www.cs-extensions.com/products/floatingadjustments/ "Floating Adjustments") (HTML Panel)
*   [Theme Switcher](http://www.cs-extensions.com/products/themeswitcher/ "Theme Switcher") (HTML Panel)
*   [Parametric Curves](http://www.cs-extensions.com/products/parametriccurves/ "Parametric Curves") (Script)

Please find the updated installer (log in the [Adobe Add-ons](https://creative.adobe.com/addons/producers/5462 "Adobe Add-ons") page if you've bought via Adobe Exchange, or in the [Bigano e-store](https://store.bigano.com "Bigano e-store") if you've bought from him). A couple of notes:

1.  **Adobe Configurator** is now useless, since it was an AIR app outputting Flash panels. There's no Adobe's HTML replacement planned, nor a migration tool for existing panels (you can go banging fists on table in the forums, or embrace the new SDK if you want / feel inclined). I've been experimenting with **templates** targeted to non-coders, that would ideally need just some minor tweaking. I know there is also somebody else (also third party) fiddling with the idea of an HTML Configurator. Don't hold your breath, but it might be that in the future something will appear.
2.  [CPT](http://www.cs-extensions.com/products/cpt/ "CPT - Channel Power Tools") (Channel Power Tools) and [False Profile](http://www.cs-extensions.com/products/falseprofile/ "False Profile") \- two extensions made by the great [Giuliana Abbiati](http://www.cromaline.net "Giuliana Abbiati") \- have not been ported yet since she's been busy with the HTML version of Dan Margulis [PPW Panel](http://www.moderncolorworkflow.com/free-resources "PPW - Picture Postcard Workflow panel"). I'll be happy to disclose information about the timeframe as soon as I have them.
