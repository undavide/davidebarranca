For those of you interested in Adobe Creative Suite developing (that is, building extensions for CS apps) there are two news that should interest you:

1.  The CS Extension Builder prerelease program is now open! You can apply filling the [participation form](https://adobeformscentral.com/?f=6V6IgvE0yLQQ7bgadxNXaw "CS Extension Builder prerelease application").
    
2.  The CS Extension Builder trial expiration has been extended to December 1st - go [download](https://www.adobe.com/cfusion/tdrc/index.cfm?product=cs_extension_builder&loc=en_us "CS Extension Builder trial") it!
    

Even if you're not (yet!) into CS developing, you should have got now that [CS Extension Builder](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/creativesuite/cs-extension-builder.html "Adobe CS Extension Builder official page") is needed... (it's a Flash Builder / Eclipse plugin, by the way).
