After 10 months since the launch of the Early Access Program, I am incredibly happy to announce that my book is now complete! Read¬†the full report below.

### The Final Version 1.0!

The book is now **12 Chapters/409 pages**, fully CC 2019 compliant: compared to the last EAP version 0.2, I've added one Chapter, an Appendix, a proper Acknowledgement section, some extra-content on ActionManager, and given it a final round of proofreading and fixes.

I've also finally credited my dear friend and colleague [Sandra Voelker](http://zettagraphics.com/) for her work as the **Technical Editor** ‚Äì she's been providing suggestions and corrections of remarkably high value.

I am also especially honored to tell you that the book contains an awesome **Foreword by Jeffrey Tranberry**, Sr. Product Manager, Digital Imaging at Adobe Systems, and author with Geoff Scott of the book "[Power, Speed & Automation with Adobe Photoshop](https://www.amazon.com/Power-Speed-Automation-Adobe-Photoshop-ebook/dp/B0083JCBZ2/)" (2012).

All in all, I am quite happy about how it has turned out: it took me _just_ two years and a half! Dare I to say, you won't find anywhere else such a comprehensive learning path that goes from the basics of the ExtendScript language, up to advanced topics such as ActionManager (~70 pages) and Adobe Generator (~60 pages).

The book V1.0. is for sale right now at [PS-Scripting.com](https://www.ps-scripting.com/), where you can also

I really hope you'll enjoy it! As I wrote in an earlier post, my intention is to match the [Adobe Photoshop HTML Panels Development](https://www.htmlpanelsbook.com/) course and add a series of video tutorials: I tested the equipment but stopped for the final rush needed to publish the book.
